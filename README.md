# data-structures
Attempts to implement basic data structures.

binary-search.py is a binary search engine recreation. Uses sorting.py as a module.

binary-search-tree.py is both an engine, and a brief demonstration of how BSTs work. Might contain errors, this had some hard to grasp algos. To work through them, I used the wiki page along with this article: http://www.laurentluce.com/posts/binary-search-tree-library-in-python
